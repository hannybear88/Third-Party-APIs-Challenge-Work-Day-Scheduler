Homework Challenge #5




## Project Description

 My live page can be seen in the <a href="#Table of Contents">Table of Contents</a> section.JS Code was created by me. The HTML and CSS codes were all already provided by UCSD Coding Bootcamp. They had already added a media query to make it user friendly for those who choose to use the "replace with correct deployed application" on either a mobile and/or tablet. You can <a href=hhttps://github.com/hannybear88/Third-Party-APIs-Challenge-Work-Day-Scheduler/>Click here</a> to see my code for this project.

## How to Use the Project

<!--replace with workday schedule deployed application -->
to be directed straight to the deployed application



AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively


GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
<!--screenshot-->

WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
<!--screenshot-->


WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
<!--screenshot-->

WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
<!--screenshot-->

WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
<!--screenshot-->

WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
<!--screenshot-- >


<!--add gif of workday schedule-->
