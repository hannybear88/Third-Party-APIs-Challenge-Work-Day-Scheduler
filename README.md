# Third-Party-APIs-Challenge-Work-Day-Scheduler
Homework Challenge #5




## Project Description

This homework assginment taught us how to generate a password that meets a certain criteria to increase security for sensitive data that the user has. We had to make sure that the password only contains the characters that the user selects "OK" to. When the user clicks "Cancel" that means they do not want to that/those specific character(s) to be part of the generated password. I wanted to challenge myself and added both a "reset button" and "copy to clipboard button". I did this so the user can easily reset their password if they made a mistake instead of clicking on the refresh button. Secondly, they can use the refresh button to easily and quickly have as many passwords generated for them. In addtion, I added the copy to clipboard button, so the user can easily copy their password to their clipboard. Instead of having to use the right click button on the mouse or use the keyboard.This helped me to impove on my javascript skills. I struggled on this since Javascript so far has been the most challenging topic we have worked on so far. My live page can be seen in the <a href="#Table of Contents">Table of Contents</a> section.The HTML and CSS codes and part of the Javascript codes were all already provided by UCSD Coding Bootcamp. They had already added a media query to make it user friendly for those who choose to use the <a href=https://hannybear88.github.io/JavaScript-Challenge-Password-Generator/>deployed application</a> on either a mobile and/or tablet.

AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively


GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
<!--screenshot-->

WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
<!--screenshot-->


WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
<!--screenshot-->

WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
<!--screenshot-->

WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
<!--screenshot-->

WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
<!--screenshot-- >
